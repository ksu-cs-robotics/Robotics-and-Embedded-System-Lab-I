## üèÅ 1. Course Overview <a name = "overview"></a>
This course is mainly designed for a sophomore (CS-23301) and junior (CS-23302)
undergraduate students who have an interest in robotics and embedded systems, with a special
emphasis on understanding basic hardware and software, and on learning those basics by doing.
Thus, this is a lap oriented class providing hands-on-experiences through a selected fun project
such as rescueRobot,miniDrone, autonomous miniCar, etc. Further, students may have an
opportunity to participate in various currently ongoing projects which are conducted at several
laboratories (ATR Lab, Scale Lab, etc.) in the CS department. Especially, students will gain
knowledge and ideas from those projects for their future capstone project in terms of project
management as well as advanced technologies in intelligent robot systems, Internet-of-Things,
etc.The course project will involve significant programming and hardware works. For Spring 2020,
mini Rescue Robot project will be conducted. Each student will build a simple ground robot and
its control programming from scratch. At the end of the semester, all students will have their
final project presentation and mini RobotCup-Rescue competition as parts of class outcomes.
